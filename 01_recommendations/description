# Item recommendation project

## Goal 

The goal of this project is to build a simple product engine recommendation for consumers. 

All you have as input is the customers name and a list of products to recommend based on the customer's gender.


## Problem 1

First we need to find out what the customers gender is, we do this by using the genderize API, shown here:

```python
import requests

requests.get('https://api.genderize.io/?name=ana')
```

## Problem 2

Create a function that given a gender, returns an appropriate product.

Male products:

- Condoms
- Male-oriented scented shaving foam
- Die Hard 4
- Larger than average shoe

Female products:

- Bras
- Flowers
- Bridgette Jones' Diary
- Smaller than average shoe

## Problem 3

You've now succeeded beyond the realms of our planet and want to recommend products to a new species of symbiotic binary humanoids called the 'florborg'.

The florborg don't have genders and their name can only contain numbers.

Add the following recommendation items for them: 

- Oil
- CPUs
- Silver suits
- Warp Cores
